# FlatWorld

Simple mod for 4D miner using MinHook  

Based on work of Discord user Koulatko#9332

To try it yourself open project in Visual Studio 2022 and build it, or just put [already built files](https://github.com/JeanSummers/4DMiner-FlatWorld/releases/tag/build) into your game folder and run `FlatWorld.exe`
